/**
 This protocol can be implemented by any classes that can be
 used to provide appearance information for keyboard actions.
 
 Unlike a style, an appearance is contextual. It requires an
 implementation, while a style is just a struct. You can use
 an appearance to generate styles that can be applied to the
 keyboard and its buttons.
 
 `KeyboardKit` will automatically create a standard instance
 when the keyboard input view controller is created. You can
 use the standard instance as is or replace it with a custom
 one if you want to customize your keyboard.
